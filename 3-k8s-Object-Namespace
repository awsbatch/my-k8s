# What are Kubernetes Namespaces?

- #### As per official documentation Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.
- #### In Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s), "ns" stands for "namespace." A namespace is a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users (via resource quota), teams, or projects. It provides a scope for Kubernetes objects, such as pods, services, replication controllers, and others.
- #### In a simpler way Kubernetes namespaces helps an organization working on/with different projects, teams, or customers to share a common Kubernetes infrastructure.
- #### Namespaces are often used to create virtual clusters within a single physical cluster, allowing teams or projects to work independently without interfering with each other's resources. They provide isolation and partitioning of resources, making it easier to manage and organize applications and services within a Kubernetes cluster.

# Why do you need namespaces?

- #### When we have a large set of Kubernetes resources running on our cluster Kubernetes namespaces helps in organizing them and allows you to group them together based on the nature of the project. By doing so you have more control over them and can effectively manage them by using unit filters.

- #### For example you can have separate namespaces created for different application life cycle environments such as development, staging, production etc. for a project or an application.
